It allows you to visually organize and tell a story that can be really, really hard to tell with words.\n\nHere's a real-life diagram I made to explain how we were going to migrate a project to a new SDK architecture by maintaining three packages: sdk-classic for all of the old APIs, sdk with all the APIs in v1 and v2, and sdk-next with just v2 APIs.
