Previous attempts to implement such a feature have not met the desired results. The goal is to provide users with the ability to watch Netflix content together, regardless of their devices, and have a synchronized video chat similar to FaceTime.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nAs a watcher of Netflix shows, I want to be able to watch with a friend the same content at the same time and talk about it.\n\nA feature that Netflix has frequently attempted but has yet to get right is having living room experiences where watchers can chat about a show in progress with their remote friends and family. We have tried just synchronized video, watch parties on Xbox, leaving text notes for future watchers, and more, but have yet to see the results we want. Yet, it is still one of the most common requests from users.\n\nThis feature attempts to put the best of all of these and put them together so that our watchers can have a true living room chat about their favorite shows as they are witnessing it together. X% of our users are watching Netflix on video-chat enabled devices, and we are going to leverage that as they have a video chat (think FaceTime-like) while watching a synchronized video.\n\n## Goals and Non-Goals\n\nGoals\n\n- Allow two people to watch a show together\n- Allow users to watch together regardless of their device as long as it has video and/or audio\n- Allow users to watch shows together as long the show is available in both users' region\n- Allow users to pause, scrub, and skip shows and have it work for both users\n- Allow users to set their own subs and dubs, which can be different for each user\n\nNon-Goals\n\n- Allow more than two users\n- Solve for users that don't have video devices\n- Encourage users to chat without watching a video\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n- Time spent watching Netflix using Watch Together\n- Time spent in chat total\n- Users who use this feature within a week of signup: indicates a user may have signed up to use this feature\n- Month-over-month retention on feature: indicates users find it useful to use it more than once\n- CSAT: after users finish a chat, a one-question survey will ask them how it went.
