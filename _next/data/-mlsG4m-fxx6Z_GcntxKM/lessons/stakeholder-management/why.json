An ad now is less valuable and that harms people already giving us money.\n- We harm businesses that don't pay for those listings; when they would have otherwise ranked higher in a search, they are being pushed down in the listings because someone paid to jump above it\n- In theory, your ranking algorithm is giving back the best results for a user searching for a \"coffee shop,\" but you are actively presenting to them something your ranking algorithm has ranked as better.
