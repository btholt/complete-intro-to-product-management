Sometimes their jobs overlap (that depends a lot on the company), but the two&#39;s primary goals are distinct. A project manager&#39;s primary goal is to keep a team aligned on what work needs to be delivered and when.

The last one there is what tends to be the most common definition of PMT: someone who specializes in managing how teams work together. They will define how teams create dependencies on each other, how products and features get reviewed before launch, and how big company-wide efforts are managed when many stakeholders are involved.</p>\n<p>Another critical role. While these imposed processes can feel like overhead, not having that overhead leads to disarray later, which creates much more work than if you had just had some alignment before. The only thing worse than process is not having process. A good TPM can accelerate the pace of work for entire companies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"program-manager\">Program Manager</h2>\n<p>This one is way less clear about what it does and varies strongly from company to company. Microsoft calls all PMs, TPMs, etc. &quot;program managers,&quot; and they perform duties contextual to their teams. Other companies call what you would typically call a TPM a program manager as they manage company-wide programs. My title at Microsoft was principal program manager, and I did product management.

This is a title given to folks in marketing who work with product teams to create marketing plans for products and features. Some of this has strong overlaps with product managers as both roles care strongly about &quot;GTM&quot; (go-to-market) plans: the plans you make for releasing products and driving interest in whatever you are releasing. I work a lot with PMMs they are wonderful folks to have on your side: they care about your great product if no one is using it. Some companies (famously Apple) make the PMs do a lot of the PMM work themselves, so it is a useful skill set to acquire.</p>\n<h2 id=\"okay-so-what-is-a-product-manager-then\">Okay, so what is a product manager then?</h2>\n<p>A product manager manages product.</p>\n<p>lol</p>\n<p>Okay, so really, a product manager does a lot of things, but their job is primarily determining what the team works on. They gather ideas, prioritize what is important, and make plans for the team to accomplish those goals based on the available resourcing.
