Because we are building our product for our stakeholders and we need to be mindful that every product decision we make doesn&#39;t just affect the users we are targeting but has a ripple effect on all of our users. It can be okay to trade off making something good for one stakeholder at the cost of another, but the point here is to be intentional. Let&#39;s make some examples (again using Maps).</p>
<h3 id="lets-make-more-money">Let&#39;s make more money</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s say we get a directive from management that we need to pull in more money for Google Maps. Take a second here and think about some ideas you would do to make more money on Google Maps.</p>
<p>One idea is to increase the amount of sponsored listings on Maps. Frequently users will search for things like &quot;coffee shop&quot; or &quot;Italian restaurant&quot; on Maps, and Maps will show preferential treatment to your business if you pay for it. So an easy path to more money is more sponsored slots. Instead of showing a max of 2 sponsored ads, we could show 5. Bam. Done. Free money.</p>
<p>But let&#39;s look at it from a stakeholder management perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do help net-new businesses that pay for those listings</li>
<li>We do harm businesses that were already being shown as sponsored listings; we have diluted the value of an ad by showing more than just 2. An ad now is less valuable and that harms people already giving us money.</li>
<li>We harm businesses that don&#39;t pay for those listings; when they would have otherwise ranked higher in a search, they are being pushed down in the listings because someone paid to jump above it</li>
<li>In theory, your ranking algorithm is giving back the best results for a user searching for a &quot;coffee shop,&quot; but you are actively presenting to them something your ranking algorithm has ranked as better. I think it&#39;s fair to say you are choosing to present an inferior user experience so you can make more money.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is actually a real story from me this week. I was looking to buy a bottle of tequila as a gift for a friend on a popular grocery delivery service, so I searched for &quot;tequila&quot; from the supermarket. This particular service had apparently sold the &quot;tequila&quot; keyword to not just other tequilas (something that would be fine, it&#39;s all tequila, and the order in which you present them to me is a choice anyway) but to other types of alcohol like vodka, hard seltzers, and bourbons. I counted, and of the 20 initial results, 50% were ads, and 40% of all results were <em>not</em> tequila but some other type of alcohol. It was a frustrating experience because I had to sift through a bunch of objectively wrong results to find what I was looking for. They sold me out as a stakeholder.</p>
<p>In this situation, should you do it? I would argue it is unlikely to increase profits enough to justify how much it adversely affects other stakeholders. Still, you would need to assess how much it degrades user experience and how much it increases profit. The metrics matter here.</p>
<h3 id="lets-improve-our-api">Let&#39;s improve our API</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s then fathom that we, as Google Maps, look at our public API and decide there are some big improvements we can make. We can make it cheaper to run, easier to use, and easier to get started with. Seems like a slam dunk win, right? Let&#39;s break it down by stakeholders.</p>
<p>This does benefit new developers to the platform. They get something that is easier and more comprehensible to work with. That is certainly a benefit.</p>
<p>This does benefit internal stakeholders as we get to run a &quot;better&quot; service for cheaper, which is a benefit.</p>
<p>This <em>can</em> benefit existing developers using our platform. In theory, if they maintain their apps, it will be easier going forward, but the big problem is that they will have to rewrite existing code that already works to keep up with your churn. Overall I would argue for most developers, that is a net negative. Existing code that works is the best. Forcing them to rewrite it because you are choosing new patterns does not benefit them; it benefits you. You are choosing your needs over theirs.</p>
<p>Inevitably many developers will not upgrade their apps, either because they don&#39;t maintain them actively or because they will choose not to. This will mean that previously working apps will cease working, which is negative for both the developers and end users of those apps.</p>
<p>Another case where you need to weigh all the options. This is a very real problem I faced at Stripe: developers <em>really</em> do not like changing code that deals with money and for good reason: bugs cost real money. Forcing them to rewrite sections is something we took super seriously and avoided at all costs. If you wrote at Stripe in 2015 and left it untouched, it very likely still works today because of how seriously Stripe takes that commitment.</p>

Because we are building our product for our stakeholders and we need to be mindful that every product decision we make doesn't just affect the users we are targeting but has a ripple effect on all of our users. It can be okay to trade off making something good for one stakeholder at the cost of another, but the point here is to be intentional. Let's make some examples (again using Maps).\n\n### Let's make more money\n\nLet's say we get a directive from management that we need to pull in more money for Google Maps. Take a second here and think about some ideas you would do to make more money on Google Maps.\n\nOne idea is to increase the amount of sponsored listings on Maps. Frequently users will search for things like \"coffee shop\" or \"Italian restaurant\" on Maps, and Maps will show preferential treatment to your business if you pay for it. So an easy path to more money is more sponsored slots. Instead of showing a max of 2 sponsored ads, we could show 5. Bam. Done. Free money.\n\nBut let's look at it from a stakeholder management perspective.\n\n- We do help net-new businesses that pay for those listings\n- We do harm businesses that were already being shown as sponsored listings; we have diluted the value of an ad by showing more than just 2. An ad now is less valuable and that harms people already giving us money.\n- We harm businesses that don't pay for those listings; when they would have otherwise ranked higher in a search, they are being pushed down in the listings because someone paid to jump above it\n- In theory, your ranking algorithm is giving back the best results for a user searching for a \"coffee shop,\" but you are actively presenting to them something your ranking algorithm has ranked as better. I think it's fair to say you are choosing to present an inferior user experience so you can make more money.\n\nThis is actually a real story from me this week. I was looking to buy a bottle of tequila as a gift for a friend on a popular grocery delivery service, so I searched for \"tequila\" from the supermarket. This particular service had apparently sold the \"tequila\" keyword to not just other tequilas (something that would be fine, it's all tequila, and the order in which you present them to me is a choice anyway) but to other types of alcohol like vodka, hard seltzers, and bourbons. I counted, and of the 20 initial results, 50% were ads, and 40% of all results were _not_ tequila but some other type of alcohol. It was a frustrating experience because I had to sift through a bunch of objectively wrong results to find what I was looking for. They sold me out as a stakeholder.\n\nIn this situation, should you do it? I would argue it is unlikely to increase profits enough to justify how much it adversely affects other stakeholders. Still, you would need to assess how much it degrades user experience and how much it increases profit. The metrics matter here.\n\n### Let's improve our API\n\nLet's then fathom that we, as Google Maps, look at our public API and decide there are some big improvements we can make.
