<p>August 1 Status Update</p>
<p>The checkout design is maintaining a good cadence of work and is checking off our tasks at a good rate. After some UX iterations we have discovered a few new issues with the existing product and we are working to incorporate those into our designs.</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<p>The UX research team found issues with the cart moving the checkout button from the right to the left as consumers were left confused as where the button was, particularly those with prior experience with our checkout experience. The team is preparing new designs to take back to the research lab to test in front of these users and see if by moving the button to the center instead would alleviate the UX friction without moving it back to the right to avoid the new shipping charges box. These redesigns are already under way and should take two weeks from the design team. We can immediately test those new designs afterwards which will take another two weeks of studies.</p>
<p>Delay</p>
<p>Because of the unexpected additional research needed, our project will miss our end-of-quarter target. Our developers are estimating that the additional work needed to rearrange the UX flow as well as additional backend work will take four weeks. While we will miss the end of quarter goal, we are only two weeks behind as once the designs are done and the UX research is underway the developers can begin working concurrently with the UX research, thus getting us closer to shipping.</p>
